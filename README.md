# GShade
**GShade is a highly modified ReShade fork & utility package with numerous improvements and settings autodetection for over 300 games.** 

Note that all shaders in this repository are intended for use with the latest GShade release. Not all shaders will work under official builds of ReShade due to the implementation of GShade's additional features. Please refer to the [license](https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade/blob/master/LICENSE.md) on the repository **and** individual file licenses for questions about distribution and modification.

**The latest Windows release can always be found below:**
* Github: https://github.com/Mortalitas/GShade/releases/latest
* Mirror: https://www.gshade.org/releases/GShade.Latest.Installer.exe

The official **GShade Linux/Unix Installation Script** for GShade can be found [here](https://www.gshade.org/releases/gshade_installer.sh). We highly recommend using the script via the following command in your terminal of choice:
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://www.gshade.org/releases/gshade_installer.sh)"
```

If you are installing GShade to **Final Fantasy XIV** on **Mac**, we highly recommend installing [XIV on Mac](https://www.xivmac.com) first. Afterwards, use the **[Linux/Unix script](https://www.gshade.org/releases/gshade_installer.sh)** via the following command in the **Terminal** app:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://www.gshade.org/releases/gshade_installer.sh)"
```
